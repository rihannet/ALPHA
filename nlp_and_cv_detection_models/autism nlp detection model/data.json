          "answers": [
            "The child may avoid eye contact and physical closeness, preferring solitary play over group activities. Social cues, such as facial expressions or body language, can be difficult to interpret, leading to difficulty in understanding others' emotions. They may not initiate or reciprocate social interactions, and there can be a preference for parallel play or engaging with objects rather than people. The child often struggles to form peer relationships and may not seek social connection, appearing detached or uninterested in group settings."

          "question": "Describe the child’s communication skills: verbal and non-verbal.",
          "answers": [
            "The child may be non-verbal or show significant delays in developing speech. Communication is often limited to repetitive speech patterns or echolalia, where they repeat words or phrases they have heard, without fully understanding their meaning. Non-verbal communication, such as gestures, eye contact, and facial expressions, may be minimal or absent. The child may struggle to express needs or emotions and often relies on others to interpret their behaviors, leading to frustration or withdrawal in social situations."

          "question": "How does the child handle changes in routine or environment?",
          "answers": [
            "Children with Classic Autism often have a strong preference for routine and predictability. Even minor changes in daily activities, surroundings, or transitions between tasks can lead to significant distress. They may react with increased anxiety, meltdowns, or repetitive behaviors like hand-flapping, rocking, or verbal outbursts. This resistance to change is often a coping mechanism to regain a sense of control and security. Unexpected events or transitions may trigger emotional overload, leading to a shutdown or refusal to engage."

        "Q4": {
          "question": "What are the child’s interests or hobbies?",
          "answers": [
            "Children with Classic Autism often develop a deep, obsessive interest in specific subjects, objects, or activities. These interests can be highly restricted and often focus on repetitive patterns or specific categories, such as trains, numbers, or mechanical objects. The child may engage with these interests for hours, exhibiting intense focus and a desire for sameness in how they engage with the objects or activities. This can limit the child’s ability to engage in other activities, particularly social or group-based play, as they may become fixated on their interest."

          "question": "How does the child express emotions?",
          "answers": [
            "Emotional expression in children with Classic Autism can be subtle or challenging to interpret. They may not display typical emotional responses such as smiling, laughing, or crying, and their facial expressions can be flat or absent. They may express distress or happiness through repetitive behaviors like rocking or hand-flapping, and emotions may be exhibited in ways that seem out of context, such as laughter in response to a stressful situation. Children may struggle to recognize or verbalize their feelings, leading to difficulties in emotional regulation."

          "answers": [
            "Children with Rett Syndrome may initially show typical social engagement, but they often experience a noticeable regression in social skills around 6 to 18 months. As the disorder progresses, the child may withdraw from social interactions, showing less interest in bonding with caregivers or peers. Eye contact and physical proximity may become uncomfortable or limited. They often exhibit a lack of initiative in social interaction and might only engage in basic, need-driven interactions, showing little spontaneous desire for social connection."

          "question": "Describe the child’s communication skills: verbal and non-verbal.",
          "answers": [
            "Children with Rett Syndrome typically lose previously acquired speech skills after a period of normal development. This regression can result in total or partial loss of verbal communication, and non-verbal communication becomes more prominent. The child may use eye gaze, facial expressions, or simple gestures to express themselves. However, verbal communication is often minimal or absent, and understanding abstract concepts or complex speech may be challenging. Some children may develop alternative communication methods, like communication boards, but these are often limited."

          "question": "How does the child handle changes in routine or environment?",
          "answers": [
            "Children with Rett Syndrome are typically sensitive to changes in routine or environment, and they may become highly distressed in unfamiliar settings. Routine disruptions, such as a change in daily activities or a new environment, often lead to emotional outbursts or physical symptoms like hand-wringing or repetitive behaviors. These reactions are a coping mechanism to handle anxiety caused by unpredictability. Familiarity and predictability are essential for comfort, and sudden changes in routine or surroundings can cause significant anxiety, leading to tantrums or withdrawal."

          "answers": [
            "The interests of children with Rett Syndrome can become increasingly limited, often revolving around sensory-based activities. These can include repetitive movements like hand-wringing, visual stimuli such as lights, or listening to certain sounds or music. Interest in social or imaginative play may be reduced, as the child’s engagement becomes more focused on self-soothing activities or repetitive behaviors. This fixation on sensory inputs may be a way for the child to seek comfort, and they may show little interest in a broad range of activities beyond these sensory experiences."

            "Emotional expression in children with Rett Syndrome is often subtle and may be expressed through non-verbal cues like facial expressions or body movements. Children may exhibit distress through physical signs, such as crying or irritability, or they might engage in self-soothing behaviors like rocking or hand-wringing. However, they may struggle to express more complex emotions such as frustration, sadness, or joy verbally. Emotional regulation is often impaired, and the child may not be able to understand or communicate their emotions effectively."

            "Children with Asperger's Syndrome may have a strong desire to engage socially but lack the necessary skills to interpret social cues. They may not understand the subtleties of body language, facial expressions, or tone of voice, which can lead to awkward interactions or misunderstandings. The child might initiate conversations but struggle with maintaining them, often focusing on a narrow topic of interest. While they may be eager to make friends, their social interactions can appear one-sided or stilted, leading to difficulty forming lasting peer relationships."

            "Children with Asperger's Syndrome typically have strong verbal communication skills but struggle with pragmatic aspects of language, such as tone, pacing, and understanding non-verbal cues. While their speech may be fluent and grammatically correct, they might sound overly formal or literal. They may struggle to understand sarcasm, idioms, or humor and could take things very literally. Their non-verbal communication is also limited, as they may not use facial expressions, gestures, or body language to complement their verbal speech, leading to misunderstandings in conversation."

They may become anxious or upset if there are changes in their environment, daily schedule, or activities. Transitions between tasks or locations can be difficult, and they may resist change by becoming agitated or displaying behaviors such as repetitive actions. They often find comfort in predictability and may struggle to cope with unexpected events, requiring additional support to manage transitions smoothly."

            "Children with Asperger's Syndrome often develop deep, narrow interests in particular subjects, such as trains, computers, or a specific area of science. They may become highly focused on their interests, sometimes to the exclusion of other activities. These hobbies can dominate conversations and activities, and the child may spend long hours engaging with their chosen subject. However, this focus can be a source of pride and confidence, as the child may possess a great deal of knowledge in their area of interest."

While they can experience emotions like joy, frustration, or sadness, they may not always express them in ways that others expect. The child may struggle to identify and label their emotions, and they may express them in an unconventional manner, such as through actions or by focusing on their interests. Understanding and expressing feelings in socially appropriate ways may require guidance and support."
